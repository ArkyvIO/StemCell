            To understand stem cell research and genetic engineering, you must
            first understand what a genome is. A genome is a collection of every
            gene in our bodies. A gene is a segment of DNA that contains the
            instructions for the production of biological molecules, usually
            proteins. Some genes determine phenotypes, or physical
            characteristics such as eye color and height. Others can influence
            our risk of developing certain genetic conditions such as sickle
            cell anemia or muscular dystrophy. Where are these genes found?
            Well, most humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, with one of each
            pair inherited from our father and the other from our mother. Most
            of our chromosomes are located in the nucleus of a cell. All of the
            DNA contained in one cell is called the genome. We have one copy of
            our genome in nearly every cell in our body. Our genomes are 99.8%
            identical to every other human on the planet. The 0.2% variation is
            what interests us in healthcare and what could help us to better
            understand the prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of
            diseases.

            Genetic Engineering is the deliberate modification of the
            characteristics of an organism by manipulating its genetic material.
            We have many uses for genetic engineering such as the way we produce
            insulin and hepatitis b vaccines. We also use this technology to
            develop disease resistant plants which help us to cut down on crop
            loss. For crops like potatoes, the loss caused by microbial
            infection is estimated to be as high as 30% (Dong & Ronald, 2019).
            With a population that is set to reach 9.8 billion by 2050,
            protecting our resources is vital (Dong & Ronald, 2019). This
            modification does not come without risks though, there is a chance
            that changing crops to prevent pathogen destruction could introduce
            new allergens into the food supply.

              Somatic cells are any cell of a living organism other than the
              reproductive cells. These consist of things like nerve cells and
              skin cells. These cells, when altered using genetic engineering,
              affect the host.

            <p>
              Stem cells are special human cells that are able to develop into
              many different cell types. These types of cells can range from
              muscle cells to brain cells and in some cases they can also fix
              damaged tissues. These cells, when altered, do affect future
              offspring.

              "I see nothing wrong ethically with the idea of correcting single

              any other kind of intervention, for anything else would be an
              experiment, which would impose our will on future generations and
              take unreasonable chances with their welfare ... Thus such
              intervention is beyond the scope of consideration."
